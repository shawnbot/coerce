# coerce
Coerce is a JavaScript toolkit for writing type coersions: functions that parse
strings into other formats with configurable defaults if the string can't be
parsed.

## Quick Start
(WRITE ME)

## Usage (Node.js)
To use coerce in Node.js:

```sh
$ npm install coerce
```

then, in your script:

```js
var coerce = require("coerce");
```

## Usage (browser)
To use coerce in your browser, just include the script:

```html
<script src="path/to/coerce.js"></script>
```

Note that `coerce.date()` requires [d3](http://d3js.org).
